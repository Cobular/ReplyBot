ReplyBot, Replying for Gamers!

This is a Discord bot written using Discord.py with the goal of adding a telegram-esque replying functionality to Discord, which I felt to be sorely needing it. It stores all messages sent on the server in a database, then allows you to search through them from within Discord in order to easily bring it back and reply to it. 

## Installation
The best way to use the bot is to use the instance I have running 

## To-Do
- [] Write an examples section with images
- [] Finish getting [Dismoc](https://github.com/JacobCover/dismock) up to speed so I can start unit testing this
- [] Re-write the search system to be fuzzy instead of the rigid system it is now
